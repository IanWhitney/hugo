A place to gather all of my various writings on the Internet. Hopefully going as far back as 2000, but we'll see what I can find in backups.

The goal is to gather up writing from the following sites:

## ianwhitney.com

Originally a pre-google Blogger site from 2000 until whenever I stopped. Now a [https://gohugo.io/](https://gohugo.io/) site.

## morethankungfu.com

Reviews of Shaw Brothers movies.

## designisrefactoring.com

Programming and refactoring.

## ianwhitney.micro.blog/

My micro.blog feed
