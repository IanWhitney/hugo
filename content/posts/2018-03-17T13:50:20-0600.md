I visited the [Taqueria la Hacienda](http://taqueriaslahacienda.com/LaHacienda/) location at 4th and E. Lake, which looks like the model for a soon-to-be-successful chain of taquerias; the colors are bright, the menu full of enticing descriptions, the staff ready to help and put up with my crappy Spanish. This place is ready to explode.

Of course, their plans will go nowhere if the food is not tasty, but no problems there. Following @heavytableâ€™s recommendation, I got a taco al pastor, my usual lengua and some suadero. That last one is new to me, but they had a bunch of signs trumpeting it and who am I to ignore their advice?

Their tacos are smaller than many of the other places Iâ€™ve been, though they are a little bit cheaper as well ($2 for most tacos). My usual 3 taco order made a small-ish lunch, so getting a side or a 4th taco may be the way to go.

The fillings were all tasty. The lengua, while not as tasty as what I got at Taqueria Mi Guanajuato, was still good. The pastor was solid, as promised, with a much more interesting mix of spices than Iâ€™ve gotten at other places. But the suadero was my favorite, a delicious balance of fattiness and char. If I did get that 4th taco, it would have been suadero.

For a change of pace I also got some horchata. I liked it well enough, but my experience with horchata is effectively nil and Iâ€™m not a big fan of sweet drinks, so Iâ€™ll leave that there.
