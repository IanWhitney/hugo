No camping this time, just an afternoon spent hiking. We walked the 5.5 mile Hiking Club trail, with a couple of small detours. William O’Brien is a great park for an afternoon walk, picnic or trip to the river. There are some hills, but the trails are mostly wide and flat.
This was my first time using [trekking poles](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dp4ZvpP8Eq4) and I’m a convert. Even on the mostly gentle trails of William O’Brien the poles were a great assist. In a couple of weeks we’re hiking the more rugged trails of [Crosby Manitou](https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/state_parks/park.html?id=spk00163#homepage) and I’ll be carrying a loaded pack. I’ll be doubly greatful for the poles then, I’m sure.
