I really like the ideas behind [Good Sudoku](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/good-sudoku-by-zach-gage/id1489118195) but so far the execution is not great. Weird bugs prevent the tutorials from working, or lead to unsolveable puzzles. And the app absolutely devours the battery of my new phone. Hopefully a few updates will fix these things.
