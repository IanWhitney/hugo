Weird aspect of my brain combining with me being a tech lead/manager.
On Friday we discover a coding problem. My brain latches on to it and figures out possible solutions throughout the weekend. But I can’t tell my team about these solutions because I don’t want to set the example of working on the weekend. As a result I show up bright and early on Monday morning with a fully designed solution & I have to act like I just came up with it and didn’t spend all of Sunday morning writing & refining it.
