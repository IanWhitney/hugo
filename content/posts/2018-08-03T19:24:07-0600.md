It started off as a light _Dirty Ho_-esque film about a shallow youngster being taught by a clever-yet-secretive elder. But as the film went on it got more-and-more â€˜seriousâ€™ and â€˜grittyâ€™, which made it less-and-less engaging. The action and acting were good, it just needed a little tonal consistency.
