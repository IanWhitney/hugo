ðŸŽ¥ _Once Upon a Timeâ€¦In Hollywood_. Pitt & DiCaprio are great together, and there are bits that are really good. But I felt no almost no emotional connection to the film at all. Maybe if I had Tarantinoâ€™s love for obscure 1969 movies and advertising.

Towards the filmâ€™s climax I strongly wanted to leave, as I didnâ€™t want to see what I thought was going to happen. That dreaded event didnâ€™t happen, but it turns out I didnâ€™t want to see what happened instead, either.
