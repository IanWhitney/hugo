The flying guillotine is a dumb weapon. Itâ€™s amazing and great, but itâ€™s also super dumb. And it needs to star in a movie that knows how dumb it is. This is why [Master of the Flying Gillotine](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0072913/) is one of the greatest films ever, it knows _exactly_ how dumb the flying guillotine is.

Shaw Brothers invented the Flying Guillotine genre (yes, itâ€™s a genre) but they never figured out how to make them entertaining. I havenâ€™t seen the first one in decades but I recall that it was mostly about farming. Farming. The movie is called _The Flying Guillotine_ and there was so much farming.

The sequel features no farming but still takes the whole thing super seriously. Thereâ€™s very little guillotine fun, instead the film spends a bunch of time on plots that go absolutely nowhere. The last ten minutes or so liven things up with a giant fight full of spinning blades, but itâ€™s a cae of too little, too late.
