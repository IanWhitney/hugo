Have money that you want to donate but aren’t sure where? I can’t answer the question for you, but here are the places that I’ve donated. This is Minneapolis focused and vaguely organized.

### Northside

*   [Northside Funders](https://giving.onecause.com/public/02ad4737-2285-4ad2-91c6-95cd66b423bf/fundraisers/c60e5030-69ce-4853-8b11-4727da5054ad/donate)
*   [Rebuild Fade Factory](https://www.gofundme.com/f/rebuild-fade-factory)

Minneapolis’ Northside is chronically overlooked (racism) and was hit by many of the arsons. Much of the focus has been on Lake Street and Powderhorn, but Northside needs donations too.

The Fade Factory fundraiser has pointers to a lot of other good places to donate.

### Lake Street

*   [Migizi](https://www.givemn.org/organization/Migizi-Communications)
*   [We Love Lake Street](https://www.welovelakestreet.com/)
*   [Dreamland Faces](https://www.gofundme.com/f/dreamland-faces)
*   [Midtown Global Market Mend](https://www.gofundme.com/f/midtown-global-market)
*   [Restore Midori’s Floating World Cafe](https://www.gofundme.com/f/restore-midori039s-floating-world-cafe)

These are all Lake Street (or Lake Street adjacent) fundraisers. All worthy of support.

### Food

*   [Second Harvest Heartland](https://www.2harvest.org/)
*   [The Food Group](https://thefoodgroupmn.org/)

Food access was a problem before the murder of George Floyd and it will continue to be a problem. These are both good resources. There are also folks on Twitter organizing Costco runs and you can donate via Venmo. [https://twitter.com/librarianrover](@librarianrover) is a good one to follow for those kind of donations.

### Media

*   [Unicorn Riot](https://unicornriot.ninja/)
*   [Sahan Journal](https://sahanjournal.com/)
*   [MinnPost](https://www.minnpost.com/)
*   [Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/)

Media. I relied on it because the story here was so chaotic. Unicorn Riot provided live streams of the protests. Sahah Journal covered the events from the immigrant perspective. MinnPost is a long-standing independent media source. And the Strib….well, their print coverage was not helpful in keeping up with the nitty gritty of the arson attacks, but their reporters were doing a bang up job on Twitter. And since I couldn’t pay the reporters directly, I gave the Strib money.

I have not yet donated to [https://minnesotareformer.com/](https://minnesotareformer.com/) because I just learned about it today. But I can see it getting a donation soon.
