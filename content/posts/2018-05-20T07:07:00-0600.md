[Access Denied](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2018-access-denied-the-missing-guide-to-authorization-in-rails). Much of the gem Vladimir introduces is meant to address things he doesn’t like in Pundit and I don’t use Pundit, so I was not the audience here. But I can definitely relate to his example of CanCanCan `ability.rb` files gone wild.
