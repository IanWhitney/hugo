After _months_ of keeping the tab open in my browser I decided to jump in and book a spot in [Only in Queens: Tasting Our Way Through New York’s Most Diverse Borough](https://culinarybackstreets.com/tours-food-tours/tours-queens/2017/queens-trip-tasting-our-way-through-new-yorks-most-diverse-borough/) offered by Atlas Obscura and [Culinary Backstreets](https://culinarybackstreets.com/). I’m super-excited and only a little bit abashed to officially become a Culinary Toursist.
