My trip to Philly should be starting now, but we’re in the airport for at least another hour. My plane will be about 80% full of 8th graders on a trip to DC. The kid is complaining mightily about how loud teenagers are. Won’t be chaotic at all!

At least I can get decent coffee in Terminal 2 and I have a good book.
