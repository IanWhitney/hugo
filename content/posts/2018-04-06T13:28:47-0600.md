I used to have an easy time at Midtown Global. Long ago I would always go to Los Ocampos and my wife would go to La Loma and we would both be happy. Then Left Hand opened; then Sonora; then Rabbit Hole; then Hot Indian; then TacoCat; then Moroccan Flavors. And so on. Now every trip there is fraught. Where do I eat this time?! And now things are harder, thanks to Mama D’s.
Much of the menu looked good but I went with some personal favorites, pulled pork sandwich and collard greens. The portion was sizeable, especially considering the lunch-special cost of $9\. The bread roll sturdy, easily able to handle the mound of pulled pork. The collards were tender and tasty, perhaps improved by a little more seasoning. But these are secondary to the pork which was an addictive blend of tender inside bits, crunchy/smokey outside bits and sauce. I’m not a BBQ geography expert so pardon me if I get this wrong, but of the BBQ I’ve had I’d place this mix of sweetness, heat and smoke seems closest to Memphis-style. Whatever the provenance, it was god.
And you could do much worse than to take your overloaded container of food over East Lake Brewery and wash the whole thing down with a beer. Even if beer is not your thing East Lake is a good destination. Next to their water station is huge selection of hot sauces – including many from [Double Take](http://www.doubletakesalsa.com) – all of which will perfectly complement your plate of southern cooking.
