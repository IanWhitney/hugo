ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 3: [Cats](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5697572/). It is as baffilingly weird and bad as youâ€™ve heard. Cats change size with each cut, and there are a lot of cuts. One of the strangest editing jobs Iâ€™ve seen. Itâ€™s like they want you to feel as disoriented and woozy as possible. Ineffable!
