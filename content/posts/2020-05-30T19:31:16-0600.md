Can’t go outside so I’m watching Jackie Chan’s _Spiritual Kung Fu_. So far he has

*   shoved a live frog down his pants
*   shoved a live eel down his pants
*   flashed his bare ass
*   Killed a live chicken (HK films never shied from showing animals being killed)
*   Pissed on a ghost

So, yeah, pretty good. Still not as weird as _Fantasy Mission Force_.
