Working my way through RailsConf 2018 videos. First up, [Actionable Tactics for Leveling Up Junior Devs](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2018-actionable-tactics-for-leveling-up-junior-devs). This one is full of good ideas to try, but the speaker is honest that some (or all) may not work for all. Things I want to try with my team:

*   Prioritize learning depth over breadth
*   Allow and support time for goofing off
*   When pairing, focus on sharing business context and not as much on coding skill
*   Screencasts as documentation
*   Assigning team members time for blogging
