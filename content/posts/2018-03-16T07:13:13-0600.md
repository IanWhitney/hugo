Apparently I could have just _walked_ to Goron City. Instead I decided to climb to a tall peak (while on fire), paraglide down (while on fire), run to the Goron City armor shop (yep, still on fire) and buy the gear necessary to put out the fire. Dumb, but I like games that let you find dumb solutions. #zeldatheneverending
