Paid a visit to [my theater](https://www.trylon.org) last night to see [_Arsenic and Old Lace_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036613/?ref_=nv_sr_1), which I havenâ€™t seen since I was a kid. A delightlfully weird and funny film. Playing 2 more times today so you still have a chance to see it on 35mm!
