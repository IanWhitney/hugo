ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 9: _[Blow the Man Down](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8299768)_. Thanks to [Switchblade Sisters](https://maximumfun.org/episodes/switchblade-sisters/episode-168-blow-the-man-down-with-mallory-omeara/) and [The Flop House](https://www.flophousepodcast.com/2021/01/episode-333-wild-mountain-thyme/) for bringing this one to my attention. An excellent, Coen-esque crime film with an excellent perception on women and small-town power.
