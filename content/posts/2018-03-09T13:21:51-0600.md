I was excited to try [Taqueria Mi Guanajuato](https://taqueriamiguanajuato.weebly.com) for two reasons: first, itâ€™s in a convenience store, and I like places that carve restaurants out of unexpected placets; second, itâ€™s on this side of Highway 55\. Most of my lunch trips involve crossing 55, the nasty unfriendly scar that carves up this part of South Minneapolis. The possibility of good tacos without crossing 55? Very enticing.

The space is bare bones â€“ a few seats at the counter, a single table. But it was nearly full when I arrived, a mix of regulars, locals and workers from nearby shops (the sort of workers that are less common along Minnehaha as the area gets younger and bougier, see also the coversion of The Rail Station -> The Howe). I took the crowd as a good sign.

Behind the counter a trio was hard at work. The service was friendly and the menu simple: tacos, quesadillas, gorditas, and burritos. I stuck with a traditional order of 3 tacos: lengua, asada and al pastor. If you get all the toppings a trio of tacos will set you back $10\. I stuck with the onion and cilantro toppings, so my total was around $8.

From what I saw, all of their masa-based food (tortillas, gorditas, etc.) are pre-packaged. I like places that cook theirs fresh, but I realize that itâ€™s a rarity. And besides, good fillings will more than make up for pre-packaged tortillas. And you can top those tacos with salsas rojo, verde and a very spicy macha, each of which are available in big containers. No shortage of salsa here.

The lengua was flavorful and stood up well on its own. Many times lengua is bland, and relies on the taco toppings to carry the day. Not so here. I dug the carne asada. Though itâ€™s not as good as Taqueria Victor Hugo, it still has a good char flavor that lingered pleasantly. The pastor was fine, but left little impression.

Taqueria Mi Guanajuato is a basic but well-run and well-executed place and Iâ€™m sure to be heading back, especially when I donâ€™t want to cross Highway 55.
