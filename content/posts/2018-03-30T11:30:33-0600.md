[Sea Saltâ€™s](https://seasalteatery.wordpress.com) seasonal schedule makes their opening & closing days serious business. Their opening heralds the coming of spring, their closing brings winter. Each trip to Sea Salt gains importance from these limitatations. If I donâ€™t make it to Sea Salt today, I might not make it until **Next Year** (dun-dun-dunnnnnn!)

And, true to Minnesota weather patterns their spring opening also guarantees 30 degree weather and snow flurries, which certainly held true today. I wished I had goggles & better gloves on my bike ride down. But excitement overwhelmed the weather, and not just for me. All seats inside were full, and a few hearty folks were taking advantage of the patio seating. But the most of the staff are returning experts, so the ship was already sailing smoothly on opening day.

My order at Sea Salt is pretty constant, scallop tacos. I know them well. By all appearances they were unchanged from last year and the year before. But the taste told a different story! The breading has changed, moved more towards a fluffier corn-meal taste instead of previous yearsâ€™ thinner, greasier breading. This is not a complaint, just an obvervation. I thought the tacos were still good. The mound of corn, crema, pico and cilanto is unchanged. The tortillas are still crisp and hearty. The beer list still a pleasant mix of the local brewery scene. Not that I had anyâ€¦.ahem.

One year they had bottles of [Isabelâ€™s Street Heat](http://www.isabelstreetheat.com/) hot sauce on hand and I was hoping to see them return this year. But no. I may start bringing my own!
