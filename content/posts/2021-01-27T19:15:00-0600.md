ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 8: [Gremlins 2: The New Batch](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0099700/). I was 10 when _Gremlins_ came out, so I saw that movie a **lot**. I was 16 when _Gremlins 2_ was released, so I think I saw it just the one time in the theater.
I canâ€™t imagine how baffling this movie would be to someone who didnâ€™t grow up in the 80s and who didnâ€™t have a deep knowledege of Chuck Jones cartoons, musicals, vaudeville, Hammer horror films, Ted Turner and UHF monster hosts. People in 1990 thought this movie was bonkers. 30 years later itâ€™s like a half-forgotten legend left behind by an ancient civilization. I got most of the jokes and Iâ€™m still somewhat baffled by it.
