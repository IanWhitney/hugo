ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 5; [Color Out Of Space](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5073642). Iâ€™ve been excited to watch this one since its release. Largely thanks to the Colin Stetson score, which I have listened to dozens of times.
The film mostly lives up to my expectations. It sounds amazing, and mostly looks fantastic. The mood of Eldritch Horror is captured well. Main drawback is the characters, who start off irritating, limiting the sympathy I felt for them as the horror commenced.
