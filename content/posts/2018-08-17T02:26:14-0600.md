36 hours awake followed by 11 hours asleep and I think I’ve mostly adjusted to the local time.

Yesterday’s walking tour from I ❤️Reykjavík was a highlight, even though (or perhaps because) it made me question why I came here at all. I also got a better understanding of why the city I last visited in 2001 is so different from the city I’m in now. ![E18D31AE-5E5C-46DA-B257-60AF553B05BE.jpg](http://ianwhitney.micro.blog/uploads/2018/209a9ce0d2.jpg)
