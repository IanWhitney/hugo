ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 1: _[Wonder Woman 84](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7126948)_. If you think your superhero movie needs to be 2.5 hours long, please think again. Some people _really_ hated this one, which I did not. But it was an example of all the things I donâ€™t like about most superhero movies. Too long, too cgi, too serious.
