Back to the East Lake Food Excursions!

I’ve been to [La Alborada](http://heavytable.com/la-alborada-market-on-east-lake-street/) a few times, so I’m ignoring my “Try new places” rule, but today’s @heavytable [Hot 5](http://heavytable.com/heavy-table-hot-five-march-2-8/) mention intrigued me. Deep cinnamon flavor sausage? Huh!

My taco trio consisted of carnitas, tinga de pollo and longaniza. The carnitas were good, still juicy and flavorful. The tinga de pollo was a bit dry for my taste; I recently came to love the Burrito Mercado’s tinga de pollo, which has large chunks of chicken & onion with a bit more sauce. The longaniza lived up to its cinnamon billing. It’s a flavor I associate so much with sweet foods that it’s somewhat odd to find in a savory taco. It’s good, just unexpected.
