In no particular order, this movie has:

*   A woman with a magic finger that shoots lasers and blood
*   A fighting corpse that speaks only English
*   A guy who uses laughter to make people explode
*   Some random dude that fights using a flute
*   Deadly flying calligraphy

‘80s wuxia – especially when made at late-stage Shaw’s – are so fun. They combine the “Let’s try everything!” ethos of ‘80s Hong Kong, the excess of wuxia, and the extensive experience of the Shaw staff. Also, they are weird as hell.
