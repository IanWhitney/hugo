Quick thoughts on [_Annihilation_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2798920/?ref_=nv_sr_1) (2018).

If you’ve read and enjoyed the book(s), then the movie may not be for you. Unless you can fully divorce it from the books, which I could not do. The film is pretty good, just not what I wanted it to be.

If you haven’t read the book and generally like ‘weird’ SF, then give it a whirl. Or watch [_Stalker_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0079944/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1), which is great and underseen.

If you haven’t read the books and don’t like weird SF, then give this one a pass.
