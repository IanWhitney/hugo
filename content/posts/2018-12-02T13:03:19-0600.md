Finished up [_Altered Traits: Science Reveals How Meditation Changes Your Mind, Brain, and Body_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34272471-altered-traits). As with most pop-science books it repeats itself far too often, but the content – discussion and analysis of scientific research of meditation – was interesting. And learning about Tibetan yogis with 30,000+ hours of lifetime meditation is one of those bittersweet, “Oh, I’ll never be able to do that” moments that leaves me both impressed and sad.
