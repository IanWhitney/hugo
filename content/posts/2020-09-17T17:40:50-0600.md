For years and years summers have meant “scallop tacos at Sea Salt.”

Although Sea Salt found a way to open this year, they didn’t offer scallop tacos. And I was OK with that; at least I had Sea Salt.

But this week, for one week only, scallops are back! And the tacos are delicious! And summer feels complete.
