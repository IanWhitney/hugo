[Apple Arcade](https://www.apple.com/apple-arcade/) is a no-brainer subscription. I’ve barely played any App Store games for years because they all rely on micro-transactions/ads/shitty gamification mechanics. Apple Arcade has [none of that](https://www.metafilter.com/183241/Imagine-not-being-screwed-with-while-you-play-mobile-games). Even if future games don’t live up to the launch titles I’m still super pleased with this.
