[Up and Down Again: A Migration’s Tale](http://confreaks.tv/videos/railsconf2018-up-and-down-again-a-migration-s-tale). Derek Prior (@derekprior) gives a good tour Migrations and what they do, which is a useful thing to know. I wanted a bit more of a dive in to [Scenic](https://github.com/thoughtbot/scenic), but the talk reminded me that I want to write a Scenic adapter for Oracle. We’ve already written an internal tool for managing Oracle views so it shouldn’t be _that_ hard.
