Hai Hai: the food was excellent; but having a nearly-all-white (tonight, at least) front-of-house staff for a “Southeast Asian street food restaurant” is weird social math. Like, I’m sure there is an exact calculation that will tell you, “If > x% of your staff are non-white, then the hipster crowd will not come to your restaurant.”
