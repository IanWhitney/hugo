[American Tacos: A History and Guide](https://bookshop.org/books/american-tacos-a-history-and-guide/9781477316528)

I have been on a bit of a taco kick of late. Well, 'of late' may be an understatement. 5 years or so. It probably started with [Heavy Table's taco writeups](https://heavytable.com/cabeza-lengua-tripa-at-taco-taxi/). That evolved in to the [Minnesota Taco Atlas](https://www.growlermag.com/mn-taco-atlas/) (to which I made a few small contributions). Then Heavy Table came back (yay!) and continued their write up of tacos and [taco adjacent foods](https://heavytable.com/oaxacans-mormons-and-a-bag-of-chips-a-brief-history-of-the-walking-taco/).

During the pandemic my taco kick has gotten deeper. I spent nights at home watching [Taco Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Chronicles). And inspired by the tortillas from [Nixta](https://www.nixtampls.com/) I've been [nixtamalizing corn](https://masienda.com/shop/nixtamal-starter-kit/) and making my own masa. And I'm just scratching the surface.

Jos√© Ralat's book shows the true depth of the taco's history and variety here in the US. Chronicling the decades long evolution of styles like breakfast and crispy tacos, or the more recent explosion of tacos combined with Korean or Indian cuisines, Ralat offers a thorough survey of tacos across the US.
