My wife has been reading Harry Potter to our daughter. Now that they’ve finished Book One, they decided to watch the first movie.

Listening to them was _amazing_. The kid was so excited by everything. “Hogwarts Express!” or “That’s not how I imagined Ms. McGonagall at all!”. If we ever take her to Wizarding World her face may melt.
