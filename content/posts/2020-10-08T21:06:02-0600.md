Tonight I got to watch [Mr. Vampire](https://www.trylon.org/films/category/horror-from-hong-kong/) for the 3rd or 4th time and it reminded me of [this primer on HK Horror/Comedies](https://web.archive.org/web/20111111131107/http://www.greencine.com/static/primers/asianhorror1.jsp) that I wrote around 16 years (!) ago.
The site that I wrote it for is long dead, so the Web Archive link will have to do for now.
Note: _Mr. Vampire_ is great. Go see it at the Trylon this weekend.
