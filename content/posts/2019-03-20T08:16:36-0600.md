I keep watching [The Corpse Flower live stream](https://cbs.umn.edu/conservatory/corpse-flower) and waiting for someone to walk in and look grossed out. That’s when I’ll know it’s time to head over to the St. Paul campus and check this flower out.

This’ll be my third corpse flower visit. But the other two times the flower was closed, which is less fun!
