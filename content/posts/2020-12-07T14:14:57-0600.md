I had a lot of pent-up cooking energy after watching a few epsiodes of [Taco Chronicles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taco_Chronicles) so I scavenged through my pantry and put togther two things that taste great on tortillas. As usual, I wasn’t working from a recipe or taking any notes. Consider these loose guidelines, not recipes. Neither of these are my invention. I’m sure you can find better versions of food like this in Mexican cookbooks.

## Spicy Tomato Beans

*   Some dry beans (I used pinto)
*   Chopped onion
*   Chopped cilantro
*   Can of tomatoes
*   As much chipotle in adobo as you want
*   Water as necessary

Mix in a pressure cooker. Have enough liquid in there for your beans to cook comfortably. You want some broth left over. Cook. Remove the beans/tomatoes/etc from the broth. Simmer the broth until it’s about half its original volume.

## Stewed Chorizo and Potatos

*   Some soft, Mexican-style chorizo
*   Onion
*   Diced potatoes
*   Reduced broth from the previous recipe

Crumble up and cook the chorizo in a frying pan. Remove the chorizo, leaving the fat. Saute the onion in the fat until it softens. Add the potatoes and the reduced broth. Simmer until the potatoes are cooked. Mix the chorizo back in and simmer for a few more minutes.
