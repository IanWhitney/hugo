ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 2: _[The Red Shoes](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0040725)_. Weirldy, even though I love the films of The Archers and despite my theater showing this film almost every year I had not seen it. So gorgeous. And, weirdly, not too different a moral than my first movie of the year, WW84\. But with a much better villain, patriarchy!
