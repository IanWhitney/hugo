Picked up Celeste for Switch. Ever since reading Derek Yu’s book about Spelunky I’ve been seeing games as an education in a language.
Celeste totally follows this path, teaching you little phrases and then requiring you to combine them into increasingly complex sentences. And when you finally ‘say’ it right the game is immensely satisfying.
