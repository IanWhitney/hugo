Are the top two flavors you want in a taco Hot and Fat? Then do I have the place for you!

[Tacos el Kevin](https://www.yelp.com/biz/tacos-el-kevin-minneapolis) is another taqueria inside a convenience store. I spotted this one a few months ago but it took me until to today to get there. I ordered a trio of tacos, suadero (which I loved so much at Taqueria la Hacienda that Iâ€™ll probably now get it everywhere), asada and pastor. Prices arenâ€™t listed, but itâ€™s about $2 a taco.

Space is at premium, so there are no tables and all orders are to go. You could probably pull up a stool and eat at one of the display counters, but I ended up eating in my car. The tacos came with the usual radish, cilantro and onion. The salsa was smooth, orange and intensely spicy. I donâ€™t know the name of this one, but I enjoyed its lingering heat.

The pastor was fine; the chicken was well flavored but I wasnâ€™t bowled over by it. The suadero and asada fillings, though, were focused on being Very Hot and Quite Greasy, without much else in the way of flavor. These are the kind of tacos I would love late at night after some ill advised drinking, but since I am old and boring that never happens.
