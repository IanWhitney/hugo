During our time in [Savanna Portage](https://www.flickr.com/photos/ianwhitney/albums/72157710144659527), my girlfriend and I decided to spend more weekends at MN State Parks. So I made [this list of the parks with camping sites](https://z.umn.edu/mnsp). I’ve included:
*   Link to the park’s website
*   Driving time (in minutes) from Minneapolis
*   Camp site type
    *   Drive in
    *   Hike in
    *   Boat in
    *   Cabin  
I haven’t included any details about Horse or Group camps because I didn’t need those.
Hopefully this is useful for folks!
