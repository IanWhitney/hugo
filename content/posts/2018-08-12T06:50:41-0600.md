A last gasp of â€˜60s Shaws in the â€˜70s _The Lady Hermit_ features female leads instead of brawny dudes, swordplay instead of fists, and a plot that features plenty of fights but is mostly concerned with romantic melodrama.

Directed by Ho Meng Hua, one of Shawâ€™s longest running directors , and staring Cheng Pei-Pei, the first big star of modern Shaw Brothers, itâ€™s no surprise that _The Lady Hermit_ feels like a film from 3-4 years earlier. Itâ€™s also one of the high-water marks for this style of film, with Cheng Pei-Pei delivering a great performance and Ho Meng Hua letting the action scenes breathe. If you need yet another reminder of Cheng Pei-Peiâ€™s greatness, check it out.
