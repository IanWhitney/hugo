ðŸŽ¥ [_My Lucky Stars_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0089177/). How to watch a Lucky Stars film: watch the first 10 minutes for the great Jackie Chan/Yuen Biao scene. Once Jackie and Yuen exit the film fast forward until Jackie comes back. These parts are pretty good and you will be saved from 60 minutes of super goofy 80s HK comedy. Even if you do have a high tolerance for 80s HK comedy I still suggest you skip the ten minutes of sexual assault â€˜jokesâ€™ in the middle of the film.
