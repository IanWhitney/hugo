La Loma is so good and so reliable that I somehow forget to go there. Sure, I _could_ go to La Loma, but maybe I should try this new, unknown place instead. As a result, itâ€™s probably been years since I had a tamale from La Loma. Ridiculous!

I had some errands around Mercado Central, which is home to a La Loma outpost. I ordered both a verde and a rojo Oaxaca tamale, because I can not resist their Oaxaca tamales. Both, unsurprisingly, were delicious. The verde was moist, tender and strongly spicy. The rojo was thicker, more stolid and with a background heat. Somehow I forgot to order an atole. Next time, which will not be years from now.
