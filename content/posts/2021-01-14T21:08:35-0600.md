ðŸŽ¥ Movies of 2021, 6: [The Masque of the Red Death](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0058333/). Vincent Price at his most diabolical, Roger Corman at his most lush (which, because itâ€™s Corman, is still pretty cheap). As usual with Corman, a 90-minute movie still feels fairly padded. But that final-reel climax is a winner.
